**Considering map size and player count**

I should focus on factors like device type, tick rate, network, competitive gameplay, POIs, density, and matchmaking when thinking about game map size and player count. For mobile-first dark fantasy roguelite matches, 8-10 players seems like a good number. Map size should scale with the match type: for small skirmishes, 6-10 players, and for battle royale, 12-24 could work. I'll also consider network optimizations, POI counts, entity limits, and server capacity, with adjustable options for arena or larger objectives.
### Map size and player count — summary recommendation
For a mobile‑first, competitive dark‑fantasy match with deterministic simulation and server authority, design for small to mid‑scale matches: **ideal default = 8–12 players per match on a map ~700–1,000 world units across** (rough square or circular playable area). Offer alternative modes: small arena (4–8 players, 200–400 units) and large objective mode (16–24 players, 1,500–2,500 units) using different interest/sharding rules.

### Rationale and constraints
- Player experience: competitive, tactical combat needs meaningful encounters but not constant cross‑fire; 8–12 players balances engagement and downtime on mobile.  
- Latency & prediction: smaller maps reduce visibility hops and entity churn, simplifying smoothing and reconciliation.  
- Device & battery: fewer concurrent visible VFX/actors keeps client GPU/CPU budgets manageable.  
- Server CPU & network: per‑tick work scales with active entities; keeping player counts modest prevents server tick overload and large state packets.  
- Procedural density: map must feel dense with POIs so players encounter choices early without huge empty travel times.

### Concrete numeric recommendations

1. Default Competitive Match (recommended)
   - Playable area: square ~800×800 world units or circular radius ≈450 units.  
   - Typical traversal: full map cross takes ~45–60 seconds at base MoveSpeed (with sprint mechanics).  
   - Player count: 8–12 concurrent players.  
   - POIs: 12–20 modular POIs (loot nodes, altars, trade nodes, small boss lairs).  
   - Resource nodes: ~40 distributed nodes; respawn policies set to avoid farming exploits.  
   - Entity budget: keep live non‑player entities ≤ 120 (projectiles, summons, critters, FX-locals) to stay under per‑tick cpu/network caps.

2. Small Arena (quick, high‑action)
   - Area: 300–400 units square.  
   - Players: 4–8.  
   - POIs: 6–9 high‑value nodes.  
   - Session length: 3–8 minutes ideal for mobile.

3. Large Objective Mode (multi‑team)
   - Area: 1,500–2,500 units square / radius ~900–1200 units.  
   - Players: 16–24 (or up to 32 with dedicated sharding interest).  
   - POIs: 30–60, with zonal objectives to funnel engagement.  
   - Server architecture: may require multi‑node interest sharding or authoritative regional proxies for scale.

### Interest management & culling strategy
- Per-client interest radius: default ~180–250 units (tuned so local engagements contain ≤ 10 other players/projectiles visible).  
- LOD tiers:
  - Tier 0 (full): entities within interest radius → send full fields (pos, vel, HP, Armor, actionState).  
  - Tier 1 (coarse): entities slightly outside → position sampled every M ticks (e.g., 3–5 ticks) with reduced event detail.  
  - Tier 2 (occluded/far): only send existence/heartbeat; spawn/despawn via aggregated events.  
- Projectile & FX interest: always send locally spawned projectiles and their authoritative IDs to owner and to nearby interest peers only.

### Server capacity planning and tick budget
- Tick rate: canonical 15 Hz. Aim to process 1 match tick in < (1/15) * targetCpuHeadroom (e.g., 6–8 ms CPU per match on a server core).  
- Entity-processing budget: assume ~0.2–0.6 ms per entity per tick (depends on physics complexity). For 120 entities, expect ~24–72 ms—split across worker pools or lower per-entity complexity to hit budget.  
- Target per-node matches: with modest hardware (8 vCPU), host 8–16 concurrent 8–12 player matches depending on simulation complexity and per‑match entity budgets. Use horizontal scaling (Kubernetes pods) for elasticity.

### Match duration and pacing
- Default match length: 8–18 minutes for competitive balance and shard pacing.  
- Short modes: 3–8 minutes (small arena) for quick sessions and better retention on mobile.  
- Long objective mode: 20–40+ minutes with staged objectives and persistent captures.

### Gameplay layout and POI density guidance
- Early engagement: place 2–3 medium POIs within 60–120 unit radius from typical spawn points to ensure initial encounters in first 60–90 seconds.  
- Mid map high value: 1–2 major contest POIs (boss lair, altar) toward center to pull players in without forcing immediate claustrophobia.  
- Movement lanes: design 2–4 natural corridors (terrain, choke points) to create tactical decision points and ambush opportunities.  
- Verticality: use small vertical differences for cover and sightlines but avoid large z-axis complexity that increases collision checks and reconciliation.

---

### Scaling to larger battles
- If you want >24 players per match:
  - Use spatial sharding: split map into authoritative sub‑regions and route client interest to the relevant shard; manage cross‑shard entity handoff at boundaries.  
  - Use hierarchical authority: local node authoritative for movement and small interactions, central authority for global outcomes and economy/payments.  
  - Increase server tick budget or lower per-tick fidelity for far-away entities (coarser simulation).

### Anti‑cheat & network implications by size
- Smaller maps + fewer players => fewer cross-client interactions, easier cheat detection and lower spoofing surface.  
- Larger maps + many players => more complex telemetry and higher anomaly false positives; increase replay retention and sampling for anti‑cheat.  
- Bandwidth: ensure ServerStatePacket sizing is capped; use coalescing and interest culling to prevent oversized snapshots in dense scenes.

### Recommended next steps (practical)
1. Prototype three map templates (Arena 300u, Default 800u, Objective 2,000u) and run simulated agent matches with expected MoveSpeed to measure encounter rates and average time‑to‑first‑contact.  
2. Run server load tests with entity budgets (projectiles, summons) to validate per‑match CPU and network costs.  
3. Tune interest radius and LOD tiers so local client visible entities are under 10–14 entities in normal combat windows.  
4. Create design doc mapping POI types to spawn density and expected shard/loot sinks for economic balance.

If you want, I’ll generate the exact test harness plan and simulation parameters to run these prototypes and output expected CPU/network numbers for your infra.
